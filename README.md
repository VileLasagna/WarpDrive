dEffective Motor
=========


dEffective is a study tool. Knowing about memory layout and cache misses and etc makes a bit sad.
Warp Drive being an engine built on inheritance, it suffers a lot from all of this and can never be "too good".
It is still cute and can be used for a variety of non-critical projects tho. It's also kind of a large a project
and has some horrendous code in a few places; plus it's old. More importantly, it's old C++.

dEffective is an attempt at maintaining a bit this code I like, making it less bad and more useful and,
most of all, dEffective is a study tool for modern C++. It's primarily a refactoring of Warp Drive intended to
make me memorize modern C++ which I'm studying hard. Unless I get to use it in some complex piece of software, I'm
certain to forget many a detail. This is where this comes in. Hopefully this also means this will become a much better piece of code too.
